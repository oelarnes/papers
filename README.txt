This folder contains my two finished papers.

The first is a paper from my time with my first advisor, Krzystov Burdzy. I describe
a new interacting particle system, which is a stochastic process consisting of
simultaneous movement and interaction of multiple particles. In this paper I derive
the hydrodynamic limit of the particle system, that is, the partial differential
equation in time and space approximated by the empirical distributions of the partical
system for large numbers of particles. In it's current state, the paper is as submitted
to the Annals of Probability. It requires revision and resubmission, but because the
content is unrelated to my current research and I am not pursuing a career in 
academia, this work is on the back burner.

The second paper describes new algorithms for the computation of certain embeddings
of trees of interest to the fields of conformal geometry, complex dynamics, and 
algebraic geometry. Adapting the zipper algorithm of Don Marshall and Steffen Rohde,
followed by an application of Newton's method allows us to calculate the polynomial
associated to a given tree to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, which had not previously
been possible. We also raise the question of limiting maps for trees of large degree. This
paper was prepared for my general exam. In the coming months we hope to expand on the
numerical work suggested by this paper to form a complete work for submission to a journal
of experimental mathematics.

A third paper, in preparation, takes up the issue of the limiting map and proves a
preliminary result indicating that the uniform measure on maps for trees of high degree
converge to non-trivial limits.
